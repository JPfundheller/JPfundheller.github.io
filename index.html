                I was born and raised in Arizona, USA where I attended Brophy College Preparatory before obtaining two Bachelors degrees at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business in the Leader's Academy. I graduated with Magna Cum Laude honors in the spring of 2017 before moving to London, UK to begin a Msc in Marketing at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

                I was the founder of a startup tutoring service, aiming to streamline the process of finding a good private tutor. Unfortunately, we were not able to secure the necessary funding and ran into several major setbacks which eventually led to the close of our company.

                As a student at ASU I studied abroad at the University of Westminster in the United Kingdom and participated in multiple intramural sports leagues. I double majored in Management and Marketing, as well as obtaining a certificate in International Business. I graduated with Manga Cum Laude honors as well as placing on the Dean's list in six of my eight terms.

                As a student at the LSE I strived to develop skills outside the classroom such as coding and general business studies. I am set to graduate in the winter of 2018, and I am on track to graduate with first honors.
